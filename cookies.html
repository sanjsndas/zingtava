                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-8">
                    Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site. Cookies enable a website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size, and other display preferences) over a period, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another. They play a crucial role in enhancing user experience and delivering personalized content. Without cookies, websites would have no memory of your past activities, making every visit a fresh start, which would be highly inconvenient for many functionalities. For instance, an online shopping cart would not be able to remember the items you added as you navigate between product pages.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold text-accent-black mb-8 text-center">How We Use Cookies</h2>

                    At Zingtava, we use cookies for various purposes to provide you with a seamless, efficient, and personalized browsing experience. Our use of cookies falls into several categories, each designed to improve different aspects of our website's functionality and your interaction with it. We utilize both first-party cookies, which are set by our website, and third-party cookies, which are set by external services that we integrate for various functionalities like analytics or advertising. The data collected through cookies helps us understand user behavior, optimize content, and ensure the security and performance of our platform. We are committed to transparency regarding our cookie usage and provide you with options to manage your preferences.

                            These cookies are fundamental for the operation of our website. They enable core functionalities such as page navigation, access to secure areas, and essential services like shopping carts or user authentication. Without these cookies, the website would not function correctly, and you would be unable to utilize many of its basic features. They are typically set only in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as logging in or filling in forms. Because they are essential for the website's basic operation, they do not require your consent and cannot be switched off in our systems. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not work.

                            Secure cookies are cookies that can only be transmitted over an encrypted HTTPS connection. This means they are protected from being intercepted by unauthorized parties while in transit, enhancing the security of your data. When a cookie is marked as "secure," the browser will only send that cookie to the server if the request is being made over a secure channel (HTTPS). This is particularly important for cookies that contain sensitive information, such as session IDs or authentication tokens, to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. We implement secure cookies wherever sensitive data is involved to protect your privacy and security.

                        <p class="mb-2">
                            HTTP-only cookies are a security feature that prevents client-side scripts (like JavaScript) from accessing the cookie. This makes it much harder for malicious scripts (e.g., cross-site scripting or XSS attacks) to steal sensitive session cookies. When a cookie is set with the "HttpOnly" flag, it means that the cookie can only be sent to the server as part of an HTTP request and cannot be accessed by JavaScript running in the browser. This significantly reduces the risk of session hijacking, where an attacker could steal a user's session cookie and impersonate them. We utilize HTTP-only cookies for critical authentication and session management purposes.

                        <p class="mb-2">
                            SameSite is a cookie attribute that helps mitigate the risk of cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks and information leakage. It works by controlling when cookies are sent with cross-site requests. There are three main values: 'Strict', 'Lax', and 'None'. 'Strict' means the cookie is only sent with requests originating from the same site. 'Lax' means the cookie is sent with same-site requests and top-level navigations from other sites (e.g., clicking a link). 'None' means the cookie is sent with all requests, including cross-site requests, but requires the 'Secure' attribute. We implement SameSite attributes to enhance the security and privacy of our users by preventing unintended cookie sharing across sites.

                            Retargeting cookies are a specific type of advertising cookie used to show you ads for products or services you've previously shown interest in.

These cookies help us deliver highly relevant advertising by reminding you of content you've engaged with, increasing the likelihood of your return to our site.

                            In some cases, Zingtava may implement server-side tracking, where data is sent from our server to third-party analytics or advertising platforms, rather than directly from your browser. While this method can reduce reliance on client-side cookies, some server-side setups may still use a form of "server-side cookie" or unique identifier passed via the server. These identifiers help maintain session continuity and user recognition for analytics and attribution purposes, offering a more robust and privacy-enhanced way of tracking compared to traditional third-party cookies. This approach aims to provide necessary data for website operations while minimizing direct browser-based tracking by third parties.
